# What is hepcon-config For

The hepcon-config github repository contains configuration files for the [HEPCon App](#hepcon---the-high-energy-physics-conference-mobile-app). The configuration files are two kinds: enabling configurations and extended configurations. The enabling configuration files are used to register an [indico](http://indico.cern.ch/) event to the mobile app. The extended configuration files are used to provide information which is not structurally available in indico such as sponsorship information and event venue location.
