# What is hepcon-config For

The hepcon-config github repository contains configuration files for the [HEPCon App](#hepcon---the-high-energy-physics-conference-mobile-app). The configuration files are two kinds: enabling configurations and extended configurations. The enabling configuration files are used to register an [indico](http://indico.cern.ch/) event to the mobile app. The extended configuration files are used to provide information which is not structurally available in indico such as sponsorship information and event venue location.

# Big Events Using the App

  * [LHCP 2018](https://indico.cern.ch/event/681549) -- The 6th Annual Large Hadron Collider Physics Conference.
  * [CHEP 2018](https://indico.cern.ch/event/587955) -- The 23rd International Conference on Computing in High-Energy and Nuclear Physics.
